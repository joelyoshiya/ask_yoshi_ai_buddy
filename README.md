# Ask Yoshi
Yoshi is a themed chatbot that works with OpenAI's chat completion API. It is designed to be a fun and easy way to interact with an otherwise vanilla chat interface.

# TODO
- [ ] Utliize chat streaming API for more responsive chat
- [ ] Allow conversations to be stored and referenced later
- [ ] Modify agent to be yoshi-themed
